odds and ends:

- fix phone number format
- add cassette dealers?
- fix login page
- search between 2 dates
- ongoing shows
- change db name
- polish UI: make buttons same size? full screen modal? look to google events for inspiration
- Google Maps autocomplete
- (node:10712) DeprecationWarning: collection.ensureIndex is deprecated. Use createIndexes instead.
