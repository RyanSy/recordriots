priority for MVP:
- create new mongo cluster for development

- use req.body.id for show edit instead of req.param?
- fix login page?
- fix phone number format
- search between 2 dates
- polish UI: google events for inspiration
- Google Maps autocomplete
- (node:10712) DeprecationWarning: collection.ensureIndex is deprecated. Use createIndexes instead.

before deployment?
- testing
