    "us", "we", or "https://recordshowmania.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain
    what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does

  <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
  <p>Like most website operators, Record Show Mania collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
    time of each visitor request. Record Show Mania's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Record Show Mania's visitors use its website. From time to time, Record Show Mania may release
    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
  <p>Record Show Mania also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Record Show Mania only discloses
    logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

  <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
  <p>Certain visitors to Record Show Mania's websites choose to interact with Record Show Mania in ways that require Record Show Mania to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Record Show Mania gathers
    depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://recordshowmania.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

  <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
    Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
